# Remote-Desktop-Monitoring-System
A network based project developed in Java by which the administrator (server) can access and interact with multiple clients logged into a network. Main advantage of this software is that the server is provided with all the privileges to monitor any client's system.
First change the host name to the sever's host name in the client code.
A_Chat_Server is the main class for the server side.
Once the server starts run A_Chat_Client_GUI on the client side.
The clients should login by entering their name and password ("client").
Then the group chat can be started and the server can receive files, screenshots and monitor the clients system.
The server can also have a personal discussion with any of the logged in users by entering their name and can also shutdown the user's system.
